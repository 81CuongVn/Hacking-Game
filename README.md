# Hacking Game
A game I made as part of an [online course on Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/problem-solving-programming-video-games). The uagame module included in the repository is a module made by the creators of the course.

## How to install
(Instructions for Windows)
1.	Download and install Python 3
2.	Check to make sure PIP is installed
3.	Install pygame by running the following code on Command Prompt  
  `pip3 install pygame`
4.	Download the source code as well as the uagame module file from the repository and run the file named ‘Hacking.py’ just as any other Python script  file

## How to play
The aim of the game is to guess the password to the system from the given words that are embedded in random characters. The user has 4 attempts to correctly guess the password, and every time the user makes an incorrect guess, the game provides a hint showing how many of the letters from the user’s guess are in the correct position.
